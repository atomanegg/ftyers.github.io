# Phonological rules

### Rule interactions
<!-- conflicts N-->


You might be wondering at this point how we can do complex transformations if we can only work with changing a single symbol at once and have no concept of rule ordering. Let's take a look at the Guaraní accentuation rules to get an idea of how rules can interact. 

There are two types of suffixes in Guaraní: tonal (meaning that they bear stress) and atonal (that do not bear stress). If a suffix is atonal the stress should be moved to the previous morpheme. 

For example locative marker *-pe* is atonal, therefore adding *-pe* to *apyka* "silla, chair" will result in *apykápe* and in the case of *ava* "gente, people", it will result in *avápe*.

Let's define two new sets of tonal and atonal vowels in `twol` file:

```
VowsTon = Á É Í Ó Ú Ý
          á é í ó ú ý ;

VowsAton = A E I O U Y
           a e i o u y ;
```
And define a new rule which changes unaccented vowel to accented before the atonal suffix.

```
"Change vowel to tonal before the atonal suffix"
Va:Vt <=> _ %>: %{m%}: e: ;
          where Va in VowsAton 
                Vt in VowsTon 
          matched;
```
The rule states: restrict the realisation of any atonal vowel in `VowAton` to appear on the surface as the tonal equivalent 
if the suffix *-{m}e* (*-pe*, *-me*) follows it.

Now check the correct forms for *apyka* and *ava*:

```bash
$ echo "apyka<n><loc>" | hfst-lookup -qp grn.gen.hfst
apyka<n><loc>	apykápe	0,000000

$ echo "ava<n><loc>" | hfst-lookup -qp grn.gen.hfst 
ava<n>+pe<loc>	avápe	0,000000
```
At the same if the last vowel of the stem is nasal as in *irũ* "amigo, friend" nothing changes as the tilde `~` symbol in 
Guaraní signifies stress as well as an *acento agudo*.

```bash
$ echo "irũ<n><loc>" | hfst-lookup -qp grn.gen.hfst
irũ<n><loc>	irũme	0,000000
```
¡Perfecto!

Now let us introduce a comparative suffix *-icha*. It is also atonal, thus we can add it to the `lexc` lexicon and 
simply define a new context in the previous `twol` rule.

```
Va:Vt <=> _ %>: [ %{m%}: e: | i: c: h: a: ] ;
          where Va in VowsAton 
                Vt in VowsTon 
          matched;
```

But what if at this point we have a noun *akãvai* "locura" that we want to add to our nominal lexicon? We will get something like that in the output:

```
akãvai<n><comp>	akãvaíicha	0,000000
```
Guaraní does not allow two vowels which are the same, therefore, we need to delete the first *i* that comes from the stem.

Let's define a new rule that deletes *-i* before the comparative *-icha*:

```
"Delete ending -[i] before comparative -icha"
Vx:0 <=> _ %>: i: c: h: a: ;
            where Vx in ( ĩ i í ) ;
```

Oh no.... What happened? We have a rule conflict now!

```

Reading rules and compiling their contexts and centers.
There is a <=-rule conflict between "Change vowel to tonal before atonal suffix SUBCASE: Va=i Vt=í" and "Delete ending -[i] before comparative -icha SUBCASE: Vx=i".
E.g. in context __HFST_TWOLC_.#.:__HFST_TWOLC_.#. _ >: i:í c:c h:h a:á __HFST_TWOLC_.#.:__HFST_TWOLC_.#.

Storing rules.
hfst-compose-intersect -1 grn.lexc.hfst -2 grn.twol.hfst -o grn.gen.hfst
```

This happened because we have contradictory rules: one rule tries to make the final *i* in the stem tonal another rule tries to delete it in the same context of *-icha* suffix.

We can confirm this by running the command `hfst-pair-test`. First let's get the output from the morphotactic side of the transducer for 
the word we are interested in.

```bash
$ hfst-fst2strings grn.lexc.hfst | grep 'akãvai<n><comp>'
akãvai<n><comp>:akãvai>icha
```
We then write out the pairs that we expect to be valid,

```bash
$ echo "a k ã v a i:0 >:0 i c h a" | hfst-pair-test grn.twol.hfst 
Rule "Change vowel to tonal before the atonal suffix  fails:
#:0 a k ã v a HERE ---> i:0 >:0 i c h a #:0 

FAIL: a k ã v a i:0 >:0 i c h a REJECTED

Test failed.
```

The command shows that the rule `"Change vowel to tonal before the atonal suffix"` rejects the pair `i:0` in the 
context `a k ã v a i:0 >:0 i c h a`.

How to handle rule conflicts so that they do not conflict with each other? In this case we can reduce the set of `VowsAton` and `VowsTon` and delete *i* from set. But it could happen that later you will need *full* sets of tonal and atonal vowels, then we can define inline sets in the rule as in *-i* deletion rule:

```
Va:Vt <=> _ %>: [%{m%}: e: | i: c: h: a:] ;
            where Va in ( a e o u y )
                  Vt in ( á é ó ú ý ) matched ;
```

And introduce an additional accentuation rule for *i* in contexts other than *-icha* (suffix *-pe* in our case). At this point our three accentuation rules should look like this:

```
"Change vowel to tonal before atonal suffix"

Va:Vt <=> _ %>: [%{m%}: e: | i: c: h: a:] ;
          where Va in ( a e o u y )
                Vt in ( á é ó ú ý ) matched ;

"Delete ending -[i] before comparative -icha"
Vx:0 <=> _ %>: i: c: h: a: ;
            where Vx in ( ĩ i í ) ;

"Change i to tonal before atonal suffixes"
i:í <=>  _ %>: %{m%}: e: ;
```

And lets check that all the words analyse correctly:

```bash
$ echo "akãvai<n>+icha<comp>" | hfst-lookup grn.gen.hfst
> akãvai<n>+icha<comp>	akãvaicha	0,000000


$ echo "ava<n>+icha<comp>" | hfst-lookup grn.gen.hfst
> ava<n>+icha<comp>	aváicha	0,000000
```
