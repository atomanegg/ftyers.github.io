# Quiz 3

1. In the reading, it is claimed that to implement a morphological
   disambiguator for an unseen language, it takes roughly the same amount
   of time whether annotating a corpus to train on versus writing
   constraint grammar rules.

   a) Give an argument for why constraint grammar rules are more
      valuable

   b) Give an argument for why corpus annotation and HMM training is
      more valuable

   Which would you prefer?

2. Can the two systems be used together? Explain.

3. Give a sentence with morphosyntactic ambiguity. What would you
   expect a disambiguator to do in this situation? What can *you* do?

4. Choose several (>2) quantities that evaluate the quality of a
   morphological disambiguator, and describe how to compute them.
   Describe what it would mean to have disambiguators which differ in
   quality based on which quantity is used.

   Suggested quantities: false positive, false negative, precision,
   recall.

5. Give an example where an n-gram HMM performs better than a unigram
   HMM tagger.
