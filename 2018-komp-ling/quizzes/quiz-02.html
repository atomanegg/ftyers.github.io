<h1>Quiz 2</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Draw a diagram of a finite-state transducer which implements
the simple rewrite &quot;'s&quot; -&gt; &quot; is&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give an example where your transducer expands &quot;'s&quot; when it
shouldn't. What information could you incorporate to fix it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following are advantages of the two-level
formalism for describing morphotactic rules? (Choose all that
apply.)</p>
<p>a) Declarative rather than procedural</p>
<p>b) Parallel application rather than sequential</p>
<p>c) More expressive than rewrite rules</p>
<p>d) Simpler notation than rewrite rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What strategies typically allow the rewriting of sequential
rewrite rules into parallel two-level rules? Provide an
example for each working strategy, and a counterexample for
each non-working strategy.</p>
<p>a) Using the rewrite rules without changes.</p>
<p>b) Underspecifying the rewrite rules</p>
<p>c) Subtracting the context of the more general rule from the
more specific</p>
<p>d) Subtracting the context of the more specific rule from the
more general</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw a diagram of a finite-state transducer implementing the simple English
pluralization model</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Implement your model in python, reading line-by-line from standard input and
writing output line-by-line.</p>
