<h1>Quiz 3</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the reading, it is claimed that to implement a morphological
disambiguator for an unseen language, it takes roughly the same amount
of time whether annotating a corpus to train on versus writing
constraint grammar rules.</p>
<p>a) Give an argument for why constraint grammar rules are more
valuable</p>
<p>b) Give an argument for why corpus annotation and HMM training is
more valuable</p>
<p>Which would you prefer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can the two systems be used together? Explain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give a sentence with morphosyntactic ambiguity. What would you
expect a disambiguator to do in this situation? What can <em>you</em> do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose several (&gt;2) quantities that evaluate the quality of a
morphological disambiguator, and describe how to compute them.
Describe what it would mean to have disambiguators which differ in
quality based on which quantity is used.</p>
<p>Suggested quantities: false positive, false negative, precision,
recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give an example where an n-gram HMM performs better than a unigram
HMM tagger.</p>
</li>
</ol>
